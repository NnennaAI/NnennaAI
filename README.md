**Build GenAI systems with intention, evaluation, and scale.**

NnennaAI is an open-source, end-to-end framework for developers building real-world Generative AI applications. It provides modular components for embeddings, retrieval, generation, evaluation, and security — all optimized for developer productivity and measurable business value.

This isn’t just another AI starter kit.  
It’s *infrastructure with intention.* 🧠🔐⚙️


## 🌟 Why NnennaAI?

Too many GenAI projects are fragile, opaque, or unscalable.  
NnennaAI exists to change that by offering:

✅ **Evaluated Outputs** – Quality and relevance metrics built in  
🧩 **Composable Architecture** – Swap out models, retrievers, and tools  
🔐 **Secure Defaults** – PII protection, safe prompt orchestration  
⚡ **Developer Productivity** – Start fast, iterate clearly, deploy confidently  
🧠 **Philosophical Infrastructure** – Build with awareness, not just speed

## 🔧 Features

- 🧠 Modular **embedding**, **retrieval**, **generation**, and **evaluation** layers  
- 🔍 Pre-integrated **evaluation tools** (Ragas + custom metrics)  
- 🏗️ Ready-to-use **templates**: RAG, agent tools, summarizers  
- 🔐 Built-in **security hooks** and safe design patterns  
- 💻 CLI tooling for scaffolding and testing pipelines  
- 📓 Google Colab labs for hands-on tutorials and onboarding  


## 👩‍💻 Who It's For

- 🛠️ **AI Engineers** building production-grade LLM apps  
- 💬 **Developer Advocates** demoing real-world GenAI patterns  
- 🏢 **Platform Teams** creating internal AI accelerators  
- 🚀 **Indie Hackers** validating AI-powered workflows  
- 🔐 **Security-Conscious Builders** deploying with confidence
