# 🤝 Contributing to NnennaAI

Thank you for considering a contribution to **NnennaAI** — the open-source framework for building evaluated, secure, and production-ready GenAI systems.

We welcome contributors of all kinds: engineers, architects, researchers, writers, and curious builders.

## 🧠 Philosophy

NnennaAI is built on three pillars:

1. **Evaluation by default**
2. **Security by design**
3. **Productivity through modularity**

If you resonate with these values, you're in the right place.

## 🛣️ Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nnennaai
    cd nnennaai
   ```

2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-contribution
   ```

3. Make your changes (see `ROADMAP.md` or open issues for ideas)
4. Run tests (if applicable)
5. Submit a pull request

## 🧭 Decision Records (ADRs)

We use architectural decision records to track major design choices.

See the `decisions/` directory for examples and templates.

If you're proposing something like a new vector DB, evaluation engine, or module pattern — write an ADR first using `0000-template.md`.

## 🧪 Areas You Can Help With

- 🧱 Templates: new RAG setups, agents, summarizers
- 🧪 Evaluation: new metrics, Galileo integrations
- 🔐 Security: better redaction, audit hooks
- 🔧 CLI: improve `nai` commands and usability
- 📓 Docs: walkthroughs, guides, and Colab tutorials
- 📣 Community: translation, content, DevRel, demos
